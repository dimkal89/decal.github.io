## About me

Hi,

I am Dimitris. I'm a PhD candidate supervised by [SÃ¸ren Hauberg](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/) and [Ole Winther](https://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/) and I'm working on the geometric and topological aspects of deep generative models.

Before I start my PhD I spent 2 years at the [Informatics Institute](https://www.iti.gr/iti/index.html) of the [Center of Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH)](https://www.certh.gr/) developing probabilistic models for anomaly detection in production lines, as well as approximate inference methods for aiding experts in the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

In general, my research interests lie in differential geometry, efficient approximate inference, deep probabilistic models and various intersections thereof.

For an overview of my research, please check my Publications page or my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=el&user=6KrveZkAAAAJ), the latter being more complete.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions on or interest in my work.
